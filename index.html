		     	This is a coding assignment based on learning the basic idea of a interface.  There are 2 classes NormalParticle, and OddballParticle which is easy to recognize from each other.  Then I created a interface called Particle that I used as a array combining NormalParticle and OddballParticle.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	then I extended the NormalParticle to make a Jumbo Particle what only had a change in one of the variable, and added it to the array of particles
